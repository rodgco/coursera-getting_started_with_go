The second argument, is the byte array or as a string and then the third argument, is the permission. So, remember WriteFile, is actually creating a new file. So, when I call WriteFile here, I'm going to create a new file called outfile.txt, and it's going to write the data ''Hello, World'' into that file. When it creates that file, it has to give that file permissions, read and write access permissions. So, it's using unix-style permission bytes. So, seven, seven, seven means permission for everybody. Everybody can do everything. But, you can adjust the permissions that you see fit, but those are the arguments to WriteFile. So again, it writes. Now remember WriteFile is not flexible. You can append to a file or something, you can't say, ''Oh! Let me just add onto the file.'' WriteFile, it just creates a file, dumps everything, the whole string, or the whole byte array into that file, and then closes the file.
